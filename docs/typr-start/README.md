# Introduction

## What is TypR?

It's not only R with types. It's a faster, safer, cooler R.

TypR is a safer counterpart of the legendary R with a transpiler written in Rust. It add cool types, a beautiful syntax and powerful modern features to the R language.

The goal is to give R package developers and developers from differents languages the opportunity to work in a better way in package management.

The project is still new and have bugs (that will be fixed soon). All the syntax basis and the features are arleady there so there won't be some big breaking change but a refinement of the core elements (and bug fix).
